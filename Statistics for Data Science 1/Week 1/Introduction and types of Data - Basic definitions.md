> [!NOTE] What is Statistics?
Statistics is a scientific discipline that deals with the **collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data**.

----
### There are two main branches of statistics:
 
> [!INFO] 1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
 >   - **Purpose**: To summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. It's about presenting facts about the data you _have_.
 >   - **How it works**: Descriptive statistics takes raw data and simplifies it into a more understandable form.

 > [!INFO] 2. **Inferential Statistics**
>    - **Purpose**: To make predictions or generalizations about a larger group (a population) based on data collected from a smaller subset of that group (a sample). It's about drawing conclusions _beyond_ the data you have.
>    - **How it works**: Because it's often impractical or impossible to collect data from an entire population, inferential statistics uses probability theory to make educated guesses or test hypotheses about the population parameters based on sample data.

> [!EXAMPLE] Example: Lenovo ThinkPad T430 Temperatures
Consider this situation: You have a Lenovo ThinkPad T430, and you want to know the average temperature of all T430s in the world.
>- **Descriptive Statistics in this context**: This would involve collecting and summarizing temperature data from _every single_ ThinkPad T430 around the world. This is likely impractical.    
> - **Inferential Statistics in this context**: Since collecting data from every T430 is impossible, you would use inferential statistics. You might collect temperature data from your T430 and a few friends' T430s (a sample). Then, using this sample data, you would make an educated guess about the average temperature of _all_ T430s worldwide.
    

> [!INFO] Population and Sample
>- **Population**: The **population** is the entire group of individuals, objects, or data points that you are interested in studying and drawing conclusions about. It's the complete set of all possible observations that fit a certain criterion.    
> 	   - _In the T430 example_: All Lenovo ThinkPad T430 laptops in the world.
>
>
>- **Sample**: A subset or portion of a larger population used to make inferences or draw conclusions about the entire population.
>    
> 	   - _In the T430 example_: Your T430 and your friends' T430s.
